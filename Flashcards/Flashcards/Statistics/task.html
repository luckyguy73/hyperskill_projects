<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Add some statistics features. We suggest you implement the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Action <code class="java">log</code> saves the application log to the given file. Save all lines that have been input in or output to the console to the file. You can use a list to store the lines.</li>
	<li>Action <code class="java">hardest card</code> prints the term of the card that has the most mistakes. You can store the mistake count in a map. If there are no cards with mistakes, you should print <code class="java">There are no cards with errors.</code>. And for multiple hardest cards, you should list them all, like in the example below.</li>
	<li>Action <code class="java">reset stats</code> erases the mistake counts for all cards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also you should update serialization/deserialization to store sets of three items (term, definition, mistakes) instead of pairs (term, definition).</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The symbol <code class="java">&gt;</code> represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>
