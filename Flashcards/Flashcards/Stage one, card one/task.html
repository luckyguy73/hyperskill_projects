<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>You may already know that a <strong>flashcard</strong> is a piece of paper that contains a <strong>term</strong> on one side and a related text you want to remember on another one. Flashcards are often used to learn a foreign language, so let's say this text is just a <strong>definition</strong> of the term.</p>

<p>We offer you to create an application that emulates a set of flashcards on a screen. While developing this application, you not only learn programming, but also save paper!</p>

<p>As a start, implement a program that outputs a single term and its definition. You can print a term and a definition you like in this stage.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">How to submit?</h2>

<p>This stage is auto-graded. The grader will check that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you output 4 lines,</li>
	<li>the first line is <code class="java">Card:</code>,</li>
	<li>the third line is <code class="java">Definition:</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examples</h2>

<p>Here are output examples to clarify what you should do.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Card:
purchase
Definition:
buy</code></pre>

<p>This is valid too:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Card:
cos'(x)
Definition:
-sin(x)</code></pre>
