  <p>Imagine&nbsp;now you are an outlaw in the Sherlock Holmes times. You are in need&nbsp;of money and you want to demand some by blackmailing.&nbsp;Obviously, you have to write a letter&nbsp;completely anonymously because you do not want to be busted.</p> 
  <p>So you decide to compose a letter by cuttings the required&nbsp;words from&nbsp;a newspaper.</p> 
  <p>In this problem, you get two lines: 1) available words you have in a newspaper, 2) your note.</p> 
  <p>Find out and print if you can write a note from available words ("<strong>You get money</strong>") or you will be busted ("<strong>You are busted</strong>").</p> 
  <p><strong>Remember</strong>:&nbsp; your note is case-sensitive</p>
