  <p>The symmetric difference of two sets is the set that contains&nbsp;elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In other words, only those elements that are present in one set and not present in&nbsp;the other. Check out the illustration for better understanding:</p>

  <p>Implement a method for finding the symmetric difference of the two given sets of strings. Elements in the resulting set can be in any order.</p> 
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p> 
  <p>The symmetric difference of two sets {1, 2, 3} and {0, 1, 2} is {0, 3}</p>
