  <p>Given a line of Java code. Of course, this line was written by good programmers, so they left a lot of comments here. But now, someone wants to actually understand how this code works, but these comments happen to be pretty uninformative and describe obvious things. Also, they interfere with reading the code.</p> 
  <p>Your task is to delete all these ugly useless comments from code.</p> 
  <p>Programmers wrote "/* this type of comments */" as well as "// this type of comments".</p> 
  <p>All comments of these&nbsp;programmers are considered bad and useless so you need to delete all of them.</p>
