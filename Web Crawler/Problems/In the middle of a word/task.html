  The first part of the input contains the part of a word.
  <br>
  <br>The second line of the input contains some sentences.
  <br>
  <br>Your task is to determine if any of these words have this part in the middle. The part cannot be at the start or at the end of the word, only in the middle. If there is such word, you should output "YES", otherwise output "NO". A word can contain only symbols of the English alphabet. You should ignore case sensitivity.
