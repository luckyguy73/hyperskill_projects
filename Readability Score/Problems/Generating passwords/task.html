  <p>The password is hard to crack if it contains at least A uppercase letters, at least B lowercase letters, at least C digits and includes exactly N symbols. Also, a password cannot contain two or more same characters coming one after another.</p> 
  <p>For the&nbsp;given numbers A, B, C, N you should output a password that matches these requirements.<br> <br> It is guaranteed A, B, C, and N are non-negative integers and A + B + C &lt;= N. Keep in mind, that&nbsp;any parameter can be equal to zero. It means that it's ok if the password doesn't contain symbols of such type.</p>
