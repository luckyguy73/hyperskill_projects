  <p>All the letters of the English alphabet are divided into vowels and consonants.<br> The vowels are: a, e, i, o, u, y.<br> The remaining letters are consonants.<br> <br> A word is considered euphonious (pleasant-sounding) if it has not three or more vowels or consonants in a row. Otherwise, it is considered discordant (harsh-sounding).<br> <br> Your task is to create euphonious words from discordant. You can insert any letters inside the word. You should output the minimum number of characters needed to create a euphonious word from a given word.<br> <br> For example, the word "schedule" is considered discordant because it has three consonants "sch" in a row. To create a&nbsp;euphonious word you need to add any vowel between 's' and 'c' or between 'c' and 'h'.</p>
